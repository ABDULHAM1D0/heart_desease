## Heart Disease Prediction Analysis
- This project analyzes the UCI Heart Disease dataset to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.
- Using Python and machine learning techniques, the project builds a predictive model to help understand key factors contributing to heart disease risk.

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Explore and analyze patient health data.
- Build a predictive model to identify patients at risk of heart disease.
- Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

# Dataset
- Source: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
- Features include patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other medical indicators.
- Target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

# Modeling Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.
- Model Selection: Logistic Regression is used as the predictive model.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is applied to find the best parameters for the model.
- Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
